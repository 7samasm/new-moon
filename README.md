New Moon Theme for Brackets
===========================

**New Moon is now available for Sublime Text! [Check it out!](https://github.com/taniarascia/new-moon-sublime)**

*Update 10/27/2015 - Improvements to matching brackets and active line*

*Update 10/23/2015 - Improvements to legibility for comments and errors*

This theme was created to be optimized for front end web development - HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP/Wordpress. It's a low contrast dark theme using color inspiration from Tomorrow Night Eighties, and style inspiration from Twilight. 

Most of the dark themes I tried using were distracting and overly colorful and contrast heavy, especially with PHP embedded into HTML. The New Moon theme strives to remedy that, with a theme that is pleasant to view in any language.
